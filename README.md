# Morning News Brief Generator 📰

An automated daily briefing system that fetches and compiles news from multiple sources, weather data, and banking industry insights into a personalized morning email.

## Features ✨

- **🌡️ Weather Data**: Current high/low temperatures for your city (using Open-Meteo API)
- **📍 Local News**: Top Seattle stories from local news sources
- **🌍 World News**: Headlines from trusted international sources (BBC, Reuters, AP)
- **🏦 Banking Summary**: AI-powered analysis of banking industry news
- **📧 Email Delivery**: Formatted HTML email via SendGrid
- **⚡ Parallel Processing**: Fast data fetching using concurrent threads
- **🔄 Development Mode**: API response caching to avoid rate limits during development
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed API calls

## Setup 🚀

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/James-api-lab/morning_brief.git
cd morning_brief
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your API keys:

```env
# Required: NewsAPI for news data
NEWSAPI_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here

# Required: SendGrid for email delivery
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
EMAIL_USER=your_verified_sender_email@domain.com
EMAIL_TO=recipient@domain.com

# Optional: OpenAI for banking news analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Development settings
DEV_MODE=true
```

### 4. Get Your API Keys

#### NewsAPI (Required)
1. Visit [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Copy your API key

#### SendGrid (Required)
1. Create account at [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Verify your sender email address
3. Generate an API key with mail send permissions

#### OpenAI (Optional)
- Only needed for AI-powered banking news summaries
- Without this key, you'll get a simple list of banking headlines

## Usage 🖥️

### Basic Usage
```bash
python morning_customv2.py
```

### Configuration Options
Edit the configuration section in `morning_customv2.py`:

```python
CITY = "Seattle"          # Change to your city
SEATTLE_LIMIT = 5         # Number of local news stories
WORLD_LIMIT = 3           # Number of world news stories
SAVE_TO_DISK = False      # Set True to save JSON snapshots
DEV_MODE = True           # Enable caching during development
CACHE_MINUTES = 30        # Cache duration in minutes
```

├── morning_customv2.py    # Main application (latest version)
├── morning_custom.py      # Earlier version
├── emailtest.py          # Email functionality testing
├── env_check.py          # Environment variable verification

└── README.md            # This file
```

## Development Mode 🛠️

Set `DEV_MODE=true` in your `.env` file to enable caching:
- API responses are cached for 30 minutes (configurable)
- Prevents hitting rate limits during development
- Cache files: `.cache_weather.json`, `.cache_seattle.json`, etc.

## Security 🔒

- **API Keys**: Never commit your `.env` file
- **Rate Limits**: Uses caching in development mode
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed API calls
- **Email Security**: Tracking disabled, no sandbox mode

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues

**"NewsAPI auth failed"**
- Check your `NEWSAPI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Verify you haven't exceeded your daily limit

**"SendGrid error"**
- Verify your sender email is authenticated with SendGrid
- Check `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_USER`, and `EMAIL_TO` settings

**"City not found"**
- Weather API uses Open-Meteo's geocoding
- Try using full city names (e.g., "New York" instead of "NYC")

### Testing Individual Components

```bash
# Test environment variables
python env_check.py

# Test email functionality
python emailtest.py

# Test SendGrid specifically
python sendgridtest.py
```
